> Adverbials of time

We use adverbials of time to say:

• when something happened:

I saw Mary yesterday.  
She was born in 1978.  
I will see you later.  
There was a storm during the night.  

• for how long :

We waited all day.  
They have lived here since 2004.  
We will be on holiday from July 1st until August 3rd.

• how often (frequency):

They usually watched television in the evening.  
We sometimes went to work by car.

We often use a noun phrase as a time adverbial:

 
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| yesterday | last week/month/year  | one day/week/month | last Saturday |
| tomorrow  |  next week/month/year | the day after tomorrow | next Friday |
| today | this week/month/year | the day before yesterday | the other day/week/month  |
