The film started at seven thirty.

when we are talking about something that continued for some time in the past

We stayed with our friends in London.

When we are talking about something that happened several times in the past we use

the past simple:

Sometimes they went out for a meal.

… or used to
Most evenings we used to stay at home and watch DVDs.

... or would
