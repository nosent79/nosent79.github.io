> I hit by their secretion.

---
지난 주 일요일에 날이 좋아서 강화로 바람쐬러 갔다. 
맛있는 수제 버거를 먹고 동막 해수욕장으로 향했다. 
갈매기들이 무척 많았다.
나는 갈매기들에게 과자를 주었는데 그들은 내게 똥을 선사했다.

Last sunday, We went to Gangwha because the day was sunny. 
We had handmade burger which was very delicious. we went to Dongmak beach. 
There was many seagull. 
I gave sweet snack for them but I hit by their secretion.
