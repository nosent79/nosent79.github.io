> Present simple and present time

---
We use the present simple to talk about:

something that is true in the present:
I'm nineteen years old.
I'm a student.
He lives in London.

something that happens regularly in the present:
I play football every weekend.

something that is always true:
The human body contains 206 bones.
Light travels at almost 300,000 kilometres per second.

We often use adverbs of frequency like sometimes, always and never with the present simple:

I sometimes go to the cinema.
She never plays football.

Here are some useful sentences. Complete them so they are true for you and try to remember them:

My name is … .
I'm … years old.
I come from … .
I live in … .	I'm a(n) … .
I … at the weekend.
I often … .
I never … .
Complete these sentences so they are true for a friend and try to remember them:

Her/His name is … .
She's/He’s … years old.
She/He comes from … .
She/He lives in … .	She's/He's a(n) … .

> Present simple and future time
We also use the present simple to talk about:

something that is fixed in the future:
The school term starts next week.
The train leaves at 19.45 this evening.

something in the future after time words like when, after and before and after if and unless:
I'll talk to John when I see him.
You must finish your work before you go home.
If it rains we'll get wet.
He won't come unless you ask him.
